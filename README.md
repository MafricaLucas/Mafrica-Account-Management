-   **Account Deletion**: Removes bank accounts from the listing.
-   **Input Validation**: Ensures all user inputs are valid with clear error messages.

## Technologies Used

-   React
-   TypeScript
-   Material-UI (for UI design)
-   Jest (for unit testing)

## Installation and Launching

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Node.js is required to manage project dependencies and run the local server.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MafricaLucas/Mafrica-Account-Management.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Navigate to the cloned project folder and run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command will install all necessary dependencies.

3. **Start the Application**
   In the same folder, start the application with:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Testing

To run the unit tests, use the following command in the project directory:

```bash
npm test
```

## Additional Information

-   **Mock API**: The application utilizes a mock API for data interactions, simplifying testing and demonstration processes without requiring a real database. If you're interested in exploring more about my expertise in APIs, I invite you to check out a personal project I developed: [Boozle Back-End](https://github.com/MafricaLucas/boozle-back). This is a Node.js back-end for a separate front-end application. It hasn't been maintained for a few months, but the code should still function properly.

-   **Design**: For the design process, I utilized Figma to create mockups of my application before beginning the coding phase. I chose to use Material UI for its user-friendly interface and design elements, which enhance the overall user experience.

-   **Tests**: Tests was my most challenging part for this exercise. I'm not used to do testing but i spend more time on them to understand and learn more about testing. They may are not the bests tests but i think they cover the code pretty well.
